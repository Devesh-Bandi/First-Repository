# Car class should have the following attributes & methods
#
# Old Attributes:
#   color, max_speed, acceleration, tyre_friction, is_engine_started, current_speed
#
# Old Methods:
#   start_engine, stop_engine, accelerate, apply_brakes
#
# New Methods:
#   sound_horn:
#       - Print "Beep Beep" if car engine is on
#       - Print "Car has not started yet" if car engine is off
#
# When a new car is created, the engine should be off by default and current_speed should be 0
